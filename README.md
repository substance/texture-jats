# Texture - JATS

A proposal for simplifications of the JATS specification.

While working on [Texture](https://github.com/substance/texture),
a WYSIWYG editor for JATS articles, we have identified flaws of the
current JATS specification.
Here, we want to propose simplifications that do not degrade the expressiveness
of JATS, but eliminate redundancy and thus should improve interoperability.
